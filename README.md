<p/>A repository of a js code for a mobile application made for a project, the project SUPER, a collaboration between the Universidade Federal do Amazonas(UFAM) with Samsung.<p/>
<p>The main idea of the project was to develop a way to check the water quality by distance, through the amazon forest region, and send it to the cloud platform ThingSpeak.<p/>
<p>Here it's shown a simple use of React Native framework, for fill our demands by developing a way to see some water parameters, using the ThingSpeak API, and monitorating it in real time through charts.</p>
